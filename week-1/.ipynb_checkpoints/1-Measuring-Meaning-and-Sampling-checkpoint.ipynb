During the September quarter, we returned over $24 billion to our shareholders, as we continue to make progress toward our goal of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.”\n",

      "</p>, <p>Computers are increasingly used in content analysis to automate the labeling (or coding) of documents. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. <a href=\"/wiki/Machine_learning\" title=\"Machine learning\">Machine learning</a> classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate.

      "</p>, <p>Content analysis is best understood as a broad family of techniques. Effective researchers choose techniques that best help them answer their substantive questions. That said, according to <a href=\"/wiki/Klaus_Krippendorff\" title=\"Klaus Krippendorff\">Klaus Krippendorff</a>, six questions must be addressed in every content analysis:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Krippendorff2004_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Krippendorff2004-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>The simplest and most objective form of content analysis considers unambiguous characteristics of the text such as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Word_frequencies\" title=\"Word frequencies\">word frequencies</a>, the page area taken by a newspaper column, or the duration of a <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> program. Analysis of simple word frequencies is limited because the meaning of a word depends on surrounding text.  <a href=\"/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context\" title=\"Key Word in Context\">Key Word In Context</a> (KWIC) routines address this by placing words in their textual context. This helps resolve ambiguities such as those introduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Synonym\" title=\"Synonym\">synonyms</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Homonym\" title=\"Homonym\">homonyms</a>.\n",
      "</p>, <p>A further step in analysis is the distinction between dictionary-based (quantitative) approaches and qualitative approaches. Dictionary-based approaches set up a list of categories derived from the frequency list of words and control the distribution of words and their respective categories over the texts. While methods in quantitative content analysis in this way transform observations of found categories into quantitative statistical data, the qualitative content analysis focuses more on the intentionality and its implications. There are strong parallels between qualitative content analysis and <a href=\"/wiki/Thematic_analysis\" title=\"Thematic analysis\">thematic analysis</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n",

These coding categories are strictly relevant to the researcher's hypothesis. Quantitative analysis also takes a deductive approach.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:12_8-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:12-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n",

He also acknowledges an \"overlap\" of qualitative and quantitative content analysis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:03_7-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-7\">[7]</a></sup> Patterns are looked at more closely in qualitative analysis, and based on the latent meanings that the researcher may find, the course of the research could be changed.
